# # Introduction: Home Credit Default Risk Competition
# This notebook is intended for those who are new to machine learning competitions or want a gentle introduction to the problem. I purposely avoid jumping into complicated models or joining together lots of data in order to show the basics of how to get started in machine learning! Any comments or suggestions are much appreciated.
# 
# In this notebook, we will take an initial look at the Home Credit default risk machine learning competition currently hosted on Kaggle. The objective of this competition is to use historical loan application data to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. This is a standard supervised classification task:
# 
# Supervised: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features
# Classification: The label is a binary variable, 0 (will repay loan on time), 1 (will have difficulty repaying loan)

# # Exploratory Data Analysis
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an open-ended process where we calculate statistics and make figures to find trends, anomalies, patterns, or relationships within the data. The goal of EDA is to learn what our data can tell us. It generally starts out with a high level overview, then narrows in to specific areas as we find intriguing areas of the data. The findings may be interesting in their own right, or they can be used to inform our modeling choices, such as by helping us decide which features to use.
# 
# Examine the Distribution of the Target Column
# The target is what we are asked to predict: either a 0 for the loan was repaid on time, or a 1 indicating the client had payment difficulties. We can first examine the number of loans falling into each category.

# ## Examine Missing Values
# From this information, we see this is an imbalanced class problem. There are far more loans that were repaid on time than loans that were not repaid. Once we get into more sophisticated machine learning models, we can weight the classes by their representation in the data to reflect this imbalance.
# 
# Next we can look at the number and percentage of missing values in each column.
# 

# In[9]:


# Function to calculate missing values by column# Funct 
def missing_values_table(df):
        # Total missing values
        mis_val = df.isnull().sum()
        
        # Percentage of missing values
        mis_val_percent = 100 * df.isnull().sum() / len(df)
        
        # Make a table with the results. Concatenar horizontalmente
        mis_val_table = pd.concat([mis_val, mis_val_percent], axis=1)
        
        # Rename the columns
        mis_val_table_ren_columns = mis_val_table.rename(
        columns = {0 : 'Missing Values', 1 : '% of Total Values'})
        
        # Sort the table by percentage of missing descending
        mis_val_table_ren_columns = mis_val_table_ren_columns[
            mis_val_table_ren_columns.iloc[:,1] != 0].sort_values('% of Total Values', ascending=False).round(1)
        
        # Print some summary information
        print ("Your selected dataframe has " + str(df.shape[1]) + " columns.\n"      
            "There are " + str(mis_val_table_ren_columns.shape[0]) +
              " columns that have missing values.")
        
        # Return the dataframe with missing information
        return mis_val_table_ren_columns


# In[10]:


# Missing values statistics
missing_values = missing_values_table(app_train)
missing_values.head(20)


# In[11]:


mis_val = app_train.isnull().sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
mis_val.head(150)


# When it comes time to build our machine learning models, we will have to fill in these missing values (known as imputation). In later work, we will use models such as XGBoost that can handle missing values with no need for imputation. Another option would be to drop columns with a high percentage of missing values, although it is impossible to know ahead of time if these columns will be helpful to our model. Therefore, we will keep all of the columns for now.

# ## Column Types
# Let's look at the number of columns of each data type. int64 and float64 are numeric variables (which can be either discrete or continuous). object columns contain strings and are categorical features. .

# In[12]:


# Number of each type of column
app_train.dtypes.value_counts()


# Let's now look at the number of unique entries in each of the object (categorical) columns.

# In[13]:


# Number of unique classes in each object column, s√≥lamente devuelve aquellos strings
app_train.select_dtypes('object').apply(pd.Series.nunique)

# Most of the categorical variables have a relatively small number of unique entries. 
# We will need to find a way to deal with these categorical variables!


# ## Encoding Categorical Variables
# Before we go any further, we need to deal with pesky categorical variables. A machine learning model unfortunately cannot deal with categorical variables (except for some models such as LightGBM). Therefore, we have to find a way to encode (represent) these variables as numbers before handing them off to the model. There are two main ways to carry out this process:
# 
# 1. Label encoding: assign each unique category in a categorical variable with an integer. No new columns are created. An example is shown below

# ![image.png](attachment:image.png)

# 2. One-hot encoding: create a new column for each unique category in a categorical variable. Each observation recieves a 1 in the column for its corresponding category and a 0 in all other new columns.

# ![image.png](attachment:image.png)

# The problem with label encoding is that it gives the categories an arbitrary ordering. The value assigned to each of the categories is random and does not reflect any inherent aspect of the category. In the example above, programmer recieves a 4 and data scientist a 1, but if we did the same process again, the labels could be reversed or completely different. The actual assignment of the integers is arbitrary. Therefore, when we perform label encoding, the model might use the relative value of the feature (for example programmer = 4 and data scientist = 1) to assign weights which is not what we want. If we only have two unique values for a categorical variable (such as Male/Female), then label encoding is fine, but for more than 2 unique categories, one-hot encoding is the safe option.
# 
# There is some debate about the relative merits of these approaches, and some models can deal with label encoded categorical variables with no issues. Here is a good Stack Overflow discussion. I think (and this is just a personal opinion) for categorical variables with many classes, one-hot encoding is the safest approach because it does not impose arbitrary values to categories. The only downside to one-hot encoding is that the number of features (dimensions of the data) can explode with categorical variables with many categories. To deal with this, we can perform one-hot encoding followed by PCA or other dimensionality reduction methods to reduce the number of dimensions (while still trying to preserve information).
# 
# In this notebook, we will use Label Encoding for any categorical variables with only 2 categories and One-Hot Encoding for any categorical variables with more than 2 categories. This process may need to change as we get further into the project, but for now, we will see where this gets us. (We will also not use any dimensionality reduction in this notebook but will explore in future iterations).

# ## Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding
# Let's implement the policy described above: for any categorical variable (dtype == object) with 2 unique categories, we will use label encoding, and for any categorical variable with more than 2 unique categories, we will use one-hot encoding.
# 
# For label encoding, we use the Scikit-Learn LabelEncoder and for one-hot encoding, the pandas get_dummies(df) function.

# In[14]:


# Create a label encoder object
le = LabelEncoder()
le_count = 0

# Iterate through the columns
for col in app_train:
    if app_train[col].dtype == 'object':
        # If 2 or fewer unique categories
        if len(list(app_train[col].unique())) <= 2:
            # Train on the training data
            le.fit(app_train[col])
            # Transform both training and testing data
            app_train[col] = le.transform(app_train[col])
            app_test[col] = le.transform(app_test[col])
            
            # Keep track of how many columns were label encoded
            le_count += 1
            
print('%d columns were label encoded.' % le_count)


# In[15]:


app_test.head(150)


# In[16]:


# one-hot encoding of categorical variables
app_train = pd.get_dummies(app_train)
app_test = pd.get_dummies(app_test)

print('Training Features shape: ', app_train.shape)
print('Testing Features shape: ', app_test.shape)


# In[17]:


app_test.head(10)


# ## Aligning Training and Testing Data
# There need to be the same features (columns) in both the training and testing data. One-hot encoding has created more columns in the training data because there were some categorical variables with categories not represented in the testing data. To remove the columns in the training data that are not in the testing data, we need to align the dataframes. First we extract the target column from the training data (because this is not in the testing data but we need to keep this information). When we do the align, we must make sure to set axis = 1 to align the dataframes based on the columns and not on the rows!

# In[18]:


train_labels = app_train['TARGET']

# Align the training and testing data, keep only columns present in both dataframes
app_train, app_test = app_train.align(app_test, join = 'inner', axis = 1)

# Add the target back in
app_train['TARGET'] = train_labels

print('Training Features shape: ', app_train.shape)
print('Testing Features shape: ', app_test.shape)


# In[19]:


app_test.head(10)
app_train.head(10)


# The training and testing datasets now have the same features which is required for machine learning. The number of features has grown significantly due to one-hot encoding. At some point we probably will want to try dimensionality reduction (removing features that are not relevant) to reduce the size of the datasets.

# ## Back to Exploratory Data Analysis
# #### Anomalies
# One problem we always want to be on the lookout for when doing EDA is anomalies within the data. These may be due to mis-typed numbers, errors in measuring equipment, or they could be valid but extreme measurements. One way to support anomalies quantitatively is by looking at the statistics of a column using the describe method. The numbers in the DAYS_BIRTH column are negative because they are recorded relative to the current loan application. To see these stats in years, we can mutliple by -1 and divide by the number of days in a year:

# In[20]:


(app_train['DAYS_BIRTH'] / -365).describe()


# In[21]:


app_train['DAYS_EMPLOYED'].describe()
# That doesn't look right! The maximum value (besides being positive) is about 1000 years!

app_train['DAYS_EMPLOYED'].plot.hist(title = 'Days Employment Histogram');
plt.xlabel('Days Employment');
plt.ylabel('Total');


# Just out of curiousity, let's subset the anomalous clients and see if they tend to have higher or low rates of default than the rest of the clients.

# In[22]:


anom = app_train[app_train['DAYS_EMPLOYED'] == 365243]
non_anom = app_train[app_train['DAYS_EMPLOYED'] != 365243]
print('The non-anomalies default on %0.2f%% of loans' % (100 * non_anom['TARGET'].mean()))
print('The anomalies default on %0.2f%% of loans' % (100 * anom['TARGET'].mean()))
print('There are %d anomalous days of employment' % len(anom))


# In[23]:


# Create an anomalous flag column
app_train['DAYS_EMPLOYED_ANOM'] = app_train["DAYS_EMPLOYED"] == 365243

# Replace the anomalous values with nan
app_train['DAYS_EMPLOYED'].replace({365243: np.nan}, inplace = True)

app_train['DAYS_EMPLOYED'].plot.hist(title = 'Days Employment Histogram');
plt.xlabel('Days Employment');


# The distribution looks to be much more in line with what we would expect, and we also have created a new column to tell the model that these values were originally anomalous (becuase we will have to fill in the nans with some value, probably the median of the column). The other columns with DAYS in the dataframe look to be about what we expect with no obvious outliers.
# 
# As an extremely important note, anything we do to the training data we also have to do to the testing data. Let's make sure to create the new column and fill in the existing column with np.nan in the testing data.

# In[24]:


app_test['DAYS_EMPLOYED_ANOM'] = app_test["DAYS_EMPLOYED"] == 365243
app_test["DAYS_EMPLOYED"].replace({365243: np.nan}, inplace = True)

print('There are %d anomalies in the test data out of %d entries' % (app_test["DAYS_EMPLOYED_ANOM"].sum(), len(app_test)))


# ## Correlations
# 
# Now that we have dealt with the categorical variables and the outliers, let's continue with the EDA. One way to try and understand the data is by looking for correlations between the features and the target. We can calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between every variable and the target using the .corr dataframe method.
# 
# The correlation coefficient is not the greatest method to represent "relevance" of a feature, but it does give us an idea of possible relationships within the data. Some general interpretations of the absolute value of the correlation coefficent are:
# 
# .00-.19 ‚Äúvery weak‚Äù
# .20-.39 ‚Äúweak‚Äù
# .40-.59 ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù
# .60-.79 ‚Äústrong‚Äù
# .80-1.0 ‚Äúvery strong‚Äù

# In[25]:


# Find correlations with the target and sort
correlations = app_train.corr()['TARGET'].sort_values()

# Display correlations
print('Most Positive Correlations:\n', correlations.tail(15))
print('\nMost Negative Correlations:\n', correlations.head(15))


# Let's take a look at some of more significant correlations: the DAYS_BIRTH is the most positive correlation. (except for TARGET because the correlation of a variable with itself is always 1!) Looking at the documentation, DAYS_BIRTH is the age in days of the client at the time of the loan in negative days (for whatever reason!). The correlation is positive, but the value of this feature is actually negative, meaning that as the client gets older, they are less likely to default on their loan (ie the target == 0). That's a little confusing, so we will take the absolute value of the feature and then the correlation will be negative.

# ## Effect of Age on Repayment
# 
# 

# In[26]:


# Find the correlation of the positive days since birth and target
app_train['DAYS_BIRTH'] = abs(app_train['DAYS_BIRTH'])
app_train['DAYS_BIRTH'].corr(app_train['TARGET'])


# As the client gets older, there is a negative linear relationship with the target meaning that as clients get older, they tend to repay their loans on time more often.
# 
# Let's start looking at this variable. First, we can make a histogram of the age. We will put the x axis in years to make the plot a little more understandable.

# In[27]:


# Set the style of plots
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')

# Plot the distribution of ages in years
plt.hist(app_train['DAYS_BIRTH'] / 365, edgecolor = 'k', bins = 25)
plt.title('Age of Client'); plt.xlabel('Age (years)'); plt.ylabel('Count');


# By itself, the distribution of age does not tell us much other than that there are no outliers as all the ages are reasonable. To visualize the effect of the age on the target, we will next make a kernel density estimation plot (KDE) colored by the value of the target. A kernel density estimate plot shows the distribution of a single variable and can be thought of as a smoothed histogram (it is created by computing a kernel, usually a Gaussian, at each data point and then averaging all the individual kernels to develop a single smooth curve). We will use the seaborn kdeplot for this graph.

# In[28]:


plt.figure(figsize = (10, 8))

# KDE plot of loans that were repaid on time
sns.kdeplot(app_train.loc[app_train['TARGET'] == 0, 'DAYS_BIRTH'] / 365, label = 'target == 0')

# KDE plot of loans which were not repaid on time
sns.kdeplot(app_train.loc[app_train['TARGET'] == 1, 'DAYS_BIRTH'] / 365, label = 'target == 1')

# Labeling of plot
plt.xlabel('Age (years)'); plt.ylabel('Density'); plt.title('Distribution of Ages');


# The target == 1 curve skews towards the younger end of the range. Although this is not a significant correlation (-0.07 correlation coefficient), this variable is likely going to be useful in a machine learning model because it does affect the target. Let's look at this relationship in another way: average failure to repay loans by age bracket.
# 
# To make this graph, first we cut the age category into bins of 5 years each. Then, for each bin, we calculate the average value of the target, which tells us the ratio of loans that were not repaid in each age category.

# In[29]:


# Age information into a separate dataframe
age_data = app_train[['TARGET', 'DAYS_BIRTH']]
age_data['YEARS_BIRTH'] = age_data['DAYS_BIRTH'] / 365

# Bin the age data
age_data['YEARS_BINNED'] = pd.cut(age_data['YEARS_BIRTH'], bins = np.linspace(20, 70, num = 11))
age_data.head(10)


# In[30]:


# Group by the bin and calculate averages
age_groups  = age_data.groupby('YEARS_BINNED').mean()
age_groups


# In[31]:


plt.figure(figsize = (8, 8))

# Graph the age bins and the average of the target as a bar plot
plt.bar(age_groups.index.astype(str), 100 * age_groups['TARGET'])

# Plot labeling
plt.xticks(rotation = 75); plt.xlabel('Age Group (years)'); plt.ylabel('Failure to Repay (%)')
plt.title('Failure to Repay by Age Group');


# There is a clear trend: younger applicants are more likely to not repay the loan! The rate of failure to repay is above 10% for the youngest three age groups and beolow 5% for the oldest age group.
# 
# This is information that could be directly used by the bank: because younger clients are less likely to repay the loan, maybe they should be provided with more guidance or financial planning tips. This does not mean the bank should discriminate against younger clients, but it would be smart to take precautionary measures to help younger clients pay on time.

# ## Exterior Sources
# The 3 variables with the strongest negative correlations with the target are EXT_SOURCE_1, EXT_SOURCE_2, and EXT_SOURCE_3. According to the documentation, these features represent a "normalized score from external data source". I'm not sure what this exactly means, but it may be a cumulative sort of credit rating made using numerous sources of data.
# 
# Let's take a look at these variables.
# 
# First, we can show the correlations of the EXT_SOURCE features with the target and with each other.

# In[32]:


# Extract the EXT_SOURCE variables and show correlations
ext_data = app_train[['TARGET', 'EXT_SOURCE_1', 'EXT_SOURCE_2', 'EXT_SOURCE_3', 'DAYS_BIRTH']]
ext_data_corrs = ext_data.corr()
ext_data_corrs


# In[33]:


plt.figure(figsize = (8, 6))

# Heatmap of correlations
sns.heatmap(ext_data_corrs, cmap = plt.cm.RdYlBu_r, vmin = -0.25, annot = True, vmax = 0.6)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap');


# All three EXT_SOURCE featureshave negative correlations with the target, indicating that as the value of the EXT_SOURCE increases, the client is more likely to repay the loan. We can also see that DAYS_BIRTH is positively correlated with EXT_SOURCE_1 indicating that maybe one of the factors in this score is the client age.
# 
# Next we can look at the distribution of each of these features colored by the value of the target. This will let us visualize the effect of this variable on the target.

# In[34]:


plt.figure(figsize = (10, 12))

# iterate through the sources
for i, source in enumerate(['EXT_SOURCE_1', 'EXT_SOURCE_2', 'EXT_SOURCE_3']):
    
    # create a new subplot for each source
    plt.subplot(3, 1, i + 1)
    # plot repaid loans
    sns.kdeplot(app_train.loc[app_train['TARGET'] == 0, source], label = 'target == 0')
    # plot loans that were not repaid
    sns.kdeplot(app_train.loc[app_train['TARGET'] == 1, source], label = 'target == 1')
    
    # Label the plots
    plt.title('Distribution of %s by Target Value' % source)
    plt.xlabel('%s' % source); plt.ylabel('Density');
    
plt.tight_layout(h_pad = 2.5)


# EXT_SOURCE_3 displays the greatest difference between the values of the target. We can clearly see that this feature has some relationship to the likelihood of an applicant to repay a loan. The relationship is not very strong (in fact they are all considered very weak, but these variables will still be useful for a machine learning model to predict whether or not an applicant will repay a loan on time.

# ## Pairs Plot
# As a final exploratory plot, we can make a pairs plot of the EXT_SOURCE variables and the DAYS_BIRTH variable. The Pairs Plot is a great exploration tool because it lets us see relationships between multiple pairs of variables as well as distributions of single variables. Here we are using the seaborn visualization library and the PairGrid function to create a Pairs Plot with scatterplots on the upper triangle, histograms on the diagonal, and 2D kernel density plots and correlation coefficients on the lower triangle.
# 
# If you don't understand this code, that's all right! Plotting in Python can be overly complex, and for anything beyond the simplest graphs, I usually find an existing implementation and adapt the code (don't repeat yourself)!

# In[35]:


# Copy the data for plotting
plot_data = ext_data.drop(columns = ['DAYS_BIRTH']).copy()

# Add in the age of the client in years
plot_data['YEARS_BIRTH'] = age_data['YEARS_BIRTH']

# Drop na values and limit to first 100000 rows
plot_data = plot_data.dropna().loc[:100000, :]

# Function to calculate correlation coefficient between two columns
def corr_func(x, y, **kwargs):
    r = np.corrcoef(x, y)[0][1]
    ax = plt.gca()
    ax.annotate("r = {:.2f}".format(r),
                xy=(.2, .8), xycoords=ax.transAxes,
                size = 20)

# Create the pairgrid object
grid = sns.PairGrid(data = plot_data, size = 3, diag_sharey=False,
                    hue = 'TARGET', 
                    vars = [x for x in list(plot_data.columns) if x != 'TARGET'])

# Upper is a scatter plot
grid.map_upper(plt.scatter, alpha = 0.2)

# Diagonal is a histogram
grid.map_diag(sns.kdeplot)

# Bottom is density plot
grid.map_lower(sns.kdeplot, cmap = plt.cm.OrRd_r);

plt.suptitle('Ext Source and Age Features Pairs Plot', size = 32, y = 1.05);


# In this plot, the red indicates loans that were not repaid and the blue are loans that are paid. We can see the different relationships within the data. There does appear to be a moderate positive linear relationship between the EXT_SOURCE_1 and the DAYS_BIRTH (or equivalently YEARS_BIRTH), indicating that this feature may take into account the age of the client.

# ## Feature Engineering
# Kaggle competitions are won by feature engineering: those win are those who can create the most useful features out of the data. (This is true for the most part as the winning models, at least for structured data, all tend to be variants on gradient boosting). This represents one of the patterns in machine learning: feature engineering has a greater return on investment than model building and hyperparameter tuning. This is a great article on the subject). As Andrew Ng is fond of saying: "applied machine learning is basically feature engineering."
# 
# While choosing the right model and optimal settings are important, the model can only learn from the data it is given. Making sure this data is as relevant to the task as possible is the job of the data scientist (and maybe some automated tools to help us out).
# 
# Feature engineering refers to a geneal process and can involve both feature construction: adding new features from the existing data, and feature selection: choosing only the most important features or other methods of dimensionality reduction. There are many techniques we can use to both create features and select features.
# 
# We will do a lot of feature engineering when we start using the other data sources, but in this notebook we will try only two simple feature construction methods:
# 
# 1.Polynomial features
# 
# 2.Domain knowledge features

# ### Polynomial Features
# One simple feature construction method is called polynomial features. In this method, we make features that are powers of existing features as well as interaction terms between existing features. For example, we can create variables EXT_SOURCE_1^2 and EXT_SOURCE_2^2 and also variables such as EXT_SOURCE_1 x EXT_SOURCE_2, EXT_SOURCE_1 x EXT_SOURCE_2^2, EXT_SOURCE_1^2 x EXT_SOURCE_2^2, and so on. These features that are a combination of multiple individual variables are called interaction terms because they capture the interactions between variables. In other words, while two variables by themselves may not have a strong influence on the target, combining them together into a single interaction variable might show a relationship with the target. Interaction terms are commonly used in statistical models to capture the effects of multiple variables, but I do not see them used as often in machine learning. Nonetheless, we can try out a few to see if they might help our model to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan.
# 
# Jake VanderPlas writes about polynomial features in his excellent book Python for Data Science for those who want more information.
# 
# In the following code, we create polynomial features using the EXT_SOURCE variables and the DAYS_BIRTH variable. Scikit-Learn has a useful class called PolynomialFeatures that creates the polynomials and the interaction terms up to a specified degree. We can use a degree of 3 to see the results (when we are creating polynomial features, we want to avoid using too high of a degree, both because the number of features scales exponentially with the degree, and because we can run into problems with overfitting).

# ## Model Interpretation: Feature Importances
# As a simple method to see which variables are the most relevant, we can look at the feature importances of the random forest. Given the correlations we saw in the exploratory data analysis, we should expect that the most important features are the EXT_SOURCE and the DAYS_BIRTH. We may use these feature importances as a method of dimensionality reduction in future work.

Feature importances are not the most sophisticated method to interpret a model or perform dimensionality reduction, but they let us start to understand what factors our model takes into account when it makes predictions.

# We see that all four of our hand-engineered features made it into the top 15 most important! This should give us confidence that our domain knowledge was at least partially on track.

# # Conclusions
# In this notebook, we saw how to get started with a Kaggle machine learning competition. We first made sure to understand the data, our task, and the metric by which our submissions will be judged. Then, we performed a fairly simple EDA to try and identify relationships, trends, or anomalies that may help our modeling. Along the way, we performed necessary preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables, imputing missing values, and scaling features to a range. Then, we constructed new features out of the existing data to see if doing so could help our model.
# 
# Once the data exploration, data preparation, and feature engineering was complete, we implemented a baseline model upon which we hope to improve. Then we built a second slightly more complicated model to beat our first score. We also carried out an experiment to determine the effect of adding the engineering variables.
# 
# We followed the general outline of a machine learning project:
# 
# Understand the problem and the data
# Data cleaning and formatting (this was mostly done for us)
# Exploratory Data Analysis
# Baseline model
# Improved model
# Model interpretation (just a little)

# ## Introduction: Manual Feature Engineering
# 
# In this notebook, we will explore making features by hand for the Home Credit Default Risk competition. In an earlier notebook, we used only the application data in order to build a model. The best model we made from this data achieved a score on the leaderboard around 0.74. In order to better this score, we will have to include more information from the other dataframes. Here, we will look at using information from the bureau and bureau_balance data. The definitions of these data files are:
# 
# bureau: information about client's previous loans with other financial institutions reported to Home Credit. Each previous loan has its own row.
# bureau_balance: monthly information about the previous loans. Each month has its own row.
# Manual feature engineering can be a tedious process (which is why we use automated feature engineering with featuretools!) and often relies on domain expertise. Since I have limited domain knowledge of loans and what makes a person likely to default, I will instead concentrate of getting as much info as possible into the final training dataframe. The idea is that the model will then pick up on which features are important rather than us having to decide that. Basically, our approach is to make as many features as possible and then give them all to the model to use! Later, we can perform feature reduction using the feature importances from the model or other techniques such as PCA.
# 
# The process of manual feature engineering will involve plenty of Pandas code, a little patience, and a lot of great practice manipulation data. Even though automated feature engineering tools are starting to be made available, feature engineering will still have to be done using plenty of data wrangling for a little while longer.

# ### Example: Counts of a client's previous loans
# To illustrate the general process of manual feature engineering, we will first simply get the count of a client's previous loans at other financial institutions. This requires a number of Pandas operations we will make heavy use of throughout the notebook:
# 
# groupby: group a dataframe by a column. In this case we will group by the unique client, the SK_ID_CURR column
# agg: perform a calculation on the grouped data such as taking the mean of columns. We can either call the function directly (grouped_df.mean()) or use the agg function together with a list of transforms (grouped_df.agg([mean, max, min, sum]))
# merge: match the aggregated statistics to the appropriate client. We need to merge the original training data with the calculated stats on the SK_ID_CURR column which will insert NaN in any cell for which the client does not have the corresponding statistic
# We also use the (rename) function quite a bit specifying the columns to be renamed as a dictionary. This is useful in order to keep track of the new variables we create.
# 
# This might seem like a lot, which is why we'll eventually write a function to do this process for us. Let's take a look at implementing this by hand first.

# In[18]:


# Read in bureau
bureau = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/Rachel/Documents/Raquel/Kaggle/Credit Risk/BD/bureau.csv')
bureau.head(5)


# In[16]:


# Groupby the client id (SK_ID_CURR), count the number of previous loans, and rename the column
previous_loan_counts = bureau.groupby('SK_ID_CURR', as_index=False)['SK_ID_BUREAU'].count().rename(columns = {'SK_ID_BUREAU': 'previous_loan_counts'})

previous_loan_counts.head()


# In[24]:


# Join to the training dataframe
train = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/Rachel/Documents/Raquel/Kaggle/Credit Risk/BD/application_train.csv')
train = train.merge(previous_loan_counts, on = 'SK_ID_CURR', how = 'left')
train.head(20)


# In[38]:


# Fill the missing values with 0 
train['previous_loan_counts'] = train['previous_loan_counts'].fillna(0)
train.head()


# ### Assessing Usefulness of New Variable with r value
# To determine if the new variable is useful, we can calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r-value) between this variable and the target. This measures the strength of a linear relationship between two variables and ranges from -1 (perfectly negatively linear) to +1 (perfectly positively linear). The r-value is not best measure of the "usefulness" of a new variable, but it can give a first approximation of whether a variable will be helpful to a machine learning model. The larger the r-value of a variable with respect to the target, the more a change in this variable is likely to affect the value of the target. Therefore, we look for the variables with the greatest absolute value r-value relative to the target.
# 
# We can also visually inspect a relationship with the target using the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot.

# ### Kernel Density Estimate Plots
# The kernel density estimate plot shows the distribution of a single variable (think of it as a smoothed histogram). To see the different in distributions dependent on the value of a categorical variable, we can color the distributions differently according to the category. For example, we can show the kernel density estimate of the previous_loan_count colored by whether the TARGET = 1 or 0. The resulting KDE will show any significant differences in the distribution of the variable between people who did not repay their loan (TARGET == 1) and the people who did (TARGET == 0). This can serve as an indicator of whether a variable will be 'relevant' to a machine learning model.
# 
# We will put this plotting functionality in a function to re-use for any variable.

# In[36]:


# Plots the disribution of a variable colored by value of the target
def kde_target(var_name, df):
    
    # Calculate the correlation coefficient between the new variable and the target
    corr = df['TARGET'].corr(df[var_name])
    
    # Calculate medians for repaid vs not repaid
    avg_repaid = df.ix[df['TARGET'] == 0, var_name].median()
    avg_not_repaid = df.ix[df['TARGET'] == 1, var_name].median()

    sns.kdeplot(df.ix[df['TARGET'] == 1, var_name], label = 'TARGET == 1')
